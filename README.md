# ðŸ“œ pelos

Pelos is a text filter which converts the typical hyphenated transliterations of Mycenaean Greek words into their original Linear B.

Passing arguments to the parser over the command-line, as well as parsing files, can be achieved through the `pelosw` wrapper included in this repository.

**Installation:**

Compile it with `make` and put the binary wherever, I'm too lazy to figure it out for you.

**Future:**

The long-term trajectory for this project is to add support for the Cypriot syllabary and logographic signs.
